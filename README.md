# Text to 3D Mesh Generator

A powerful text-to-3D mesh generator that creates **Unity-ready** terrain, environments, and basic shapes from textual descriptions. This project generates realistic 3D landscapes including mountains, forests, lakes, and deserts using procedural generation techniques with **automatic colors and collision**.

## üéÆ Unity-Ready Features

- **üé® Automatic Colors**: Vertex colors applied based on height and environment type
- **üí• Collision Meshes**: Optimized collision meshes for Unity physics
- **üèóÔ∏è Unity Materials**: Pre-configured materials with proper shaders and properties
- **‚ö° Physics Materials**: Realistic friction and bounciness for different surfaces
- **üì¶ Prefab Metadata**: JSON files with complete Unity component setup
- **üîÑ Automatic Transformations**: 90¬∞ X-axis rotation and 10x scaling for Unity
- **üìê Proper Coordinate System**: Left-handed coordinate system for Unity

## Features
- **Terrain Generation**: Create mountains, hills, valleys, plateaus, and canyons
- **Environment Creation**: Generate forests, lakes, deserts, and other landscapes
- **Procedural Generation**: Uses Perlin noise for realistic terrain variation
- **Basic Shapes**: Traditional geometric primitives (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone)
- **Local Processing**: Runs entirely on your machine without external dependencies
- **Unity Integration**: Optimized mesh output for Unity game development
- **Automatic Transformations**: All outputs are automatically rotated and scaled for optimal viewing

## Automatic Transformations
All generated meshes automatically receive the following transformations:
- **90¬∞ X-axis Rotation**: Rotates Y‚ÜíZ and Z‚Üí-Y for better orientation
- **10x Scaling**: Increases all dimensions by 10x for better visibility and detail

```bash
python -m venv venv

```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Output Files

For each generation, you get:

1. **`mesh_name.obj`** - Visual mesh with vertex colors
2. **`mesh_name_collision.obj`** - Optimized collision mesh
3. **`mesh_name_prefab.json`** - Unity prefab metadata with materials and physics

## Unity Import

### Quick Start
1. **Import meshes** into Unity Assets folder
2. **Create materials** based on the prefab JSON files
3. **Set up GameObjects** with MeshRenderer and MeshCollider
4. **Assign materials** and physics materials
5. **Position and scale** as needed

### Detailed Guide
See `UNITY_IMPORT_GUIDE.md` for complete Unity import instructions.

## Testing

Run the Unity export test to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_unity_export.py
```

This will generate test meshes with all Unity features enabled.

## Tips for Best Results
1. Use descriptive terms like "tall", "wide", "steep", "gentle"
2. Specify size with units: "100 meters wide"
3. Request high resolution for detailed terrain
4. Combine terrain types: "rocky mountain with forest"
5. Use environment keywords: "forest", "lake", "desert"
6. Remember that all outputs are 10x larger than specified
7. Colors and collision are automatically applied
8. Unity materials and physics are pre-configured
